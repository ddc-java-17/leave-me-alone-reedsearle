## Navigation

Navigation is accomplished in three ways:

 - User navigation is button-based.  All navigation option for the user involve buttons with the exception of when the app is armed.
 - Once the app is armed, the only navigation option is to correctly enter the disarm code.
 - Automatic navigation is accomplished by motion (Arm to Warning), or timer (Warning to Alarm).
