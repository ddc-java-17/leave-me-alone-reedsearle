## Summary

The Leave Me alone app is designed to provide additional security to those people who frequently
have their phones in public places. The app, once activated, will sound an alarm if the phone is
moved before the unlock code is entered.  Additionally, the app will determine which camera is
facing up and take a photo.  This photo will be sent to the user's email address to assist in
identifying the phone theft culprit.

## Functionality

The user will be able to do the following:
* Set an alarm type, similar to ringtone only much louder
* Set method of engagement, either manually or automatically when the screen times out
* set an address (email, text, Whatsapp) to which photos to be sent in the event of theft
* set an authentication code to disable the alarm
* set a delay for entering the authentication code
